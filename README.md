<p>I was following this Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022</a> and the final project was creating a CRUD website.</p>
<p>To immediately practice what I learned I created a similar website. The main focus was implementing mongodb, express and learning about routes and CRUD. I didn't focus on the front-end and choose to use Bulma to save time.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be a production ready website. For example: a 'movie theater admin' has to manually fill in a form to add a movie, instead of choosing one in a database. Or when a user registers the user himself can get a 'cinema author' role by clicking a radio button.</p>

I wanted to add a star rating to the cinemas and used following article as my guide:

- [CSS-tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/five-methods-for-five-star-ratings/ 'CSS-tricks article')

## What I have learned

I have learned a lot, because going from a HTML/CSS/JS only website to this is a big step. This project site is a bit larger then the example shown in the course. So for some bits I couldn't rely on the code of that project.

What I will certainly take with me in the future is to take time when I structure my mongodb documents.

## Things I may change in the future

As I said in the beginning this is not a website to stage on a live environment. There are to many things not how it should be. I assume if I would tackle all the flaws and make it perfect, it would flatten my learning curve.
