<p>I was following this Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022</a> and the final project was creating a CRUD website.</p>
<p>To immediately practice what I learned I created a similar website. The main focus was implementing mongo, express and learning about routes and CRUD. I didn't focus on the front-end and choose to use Bulma to save time.</p>

## Sources

I didn't know how to create the pagination in JavaScript, so I followed the tutorial below and adapted it to my needs:

- [Tutsplus tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/pagination-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-41896 'Tutsplus tutorial')

## What I have learned

As I still have to learn a lot, it was interesting to create an own design and transforming it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a working website. What I experienced is I need a lot more practice. The most challenging part was creating the WYSIWYG editor.

- I used [Window.getSelection()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getSelection 'Window.getSelection()'). It was a learning process to detect which part of the contenteditable div was selectable and which not

- I learned about async function to fetch a JSON-file. But I probably did some things wrong (see below in the Things I may change in the future).

- How to retrieve a query parameter in an URL

- Played a little bit with a Date object

- It is not possible to write data to a JSON-file with JavaScript only

## Things I may change in the future

I think there are still a lot of tweaks possible, but the current goal is not to make every project perfect. But try to learn as much as possible.

- Using a technique to write my data to a JSON-file instead of copying it to the clipboard

- Adding a favicon

- If you paste text in the WYSIWYG editor it keeps it lay-out. I would like to keep the plain text only

- When I am more experienced I think I can make it more performant in all domains: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Same as above: refactor

## Conclusion

> This is not something I would deliver to a client, but it was a great learning process
